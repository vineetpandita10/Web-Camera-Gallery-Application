# Web-Camera-Gallery-Application
Used many Browser in-build APIs. We can record Videos and capture Images plus can also add different filters to the Videos/Images. All the Media files will be saved in the applications In-Build Gallery, and we can even delete or download the media to our PC. And to store and manage the media files we have used IndexedDB as our client side storage NoSQL database.
